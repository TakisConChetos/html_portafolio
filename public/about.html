<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Diana Elizabeth, a passionate learner with a strong foundation in STEM and a love for exploring the intersection of science, education, and creativity. I’m currently pursuing a technical degree in Pharmaceutical Chemistry while actively engaging in projects that inspire change, from science communication to educational advocacy.</p>
<p> I enjoy simplifying complex ideas, whether it's through teaching math, writing, or creating engaging content. Beyond academics, I’m a self-taught guitarist, a martial arts enthusiast, and a dedicated student of languages.</p>
<p>Let’s connect and collaborate to turn ideas into impact!</p>
